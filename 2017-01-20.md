MINIMIZING THE COSTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT UNTIL IT IS REPEALED

By the authority vested in me as President, by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. It is the intention of my Administration to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), together known as "the ACA". In the meantime, it is important for the executive branch to ensure that the law is being enforced with minimal negative impact. We must do as much as legally possible to reduce the unnecessary costs and restrictions of the ACA. We must also prepare to give the States more flexibility and control to create a more open healthcare market.

Sec. 2. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA must exercise all authority and discretion available to them to help the States. These leaders must do as much as legally possible to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or rule of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on any State. These leaders must do the same for any cost, fee, tax, penalty, or restriction that may affect individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.

Sec. 3. These same leaders must do as much as legally possible to provide greater flexibility to States and work with them in creating healthcare programs.

Sec. 4. These same leaders must do as much as legally possible to encourage the creation of a free and open market that allows patients and consumers to buy healthcare services and health insurance over state lines, with the goal of giving patients and consumers the greatest options.

Sec. 5. If any actions taken to follow this order need law revisions that must be reviewed by the public, they must follow the usual process of  "notice-and-comment rulemaking".

Sec. 6. (a) Nothing in this executive order should be used to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head of either.
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) All actions taken following this executive order must follow all current laws. All actions taken to follow this order must only work to the extent that federal funds are available.

(c) This order does not create any right, legal benefit, or financial benefit for any party against any part of the United States government or any other person.
