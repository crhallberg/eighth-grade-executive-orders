EXPEDITING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS AND APPROVALS FOR HIGH PRIORITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
--

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows:

Section 1. Purpose. Infrastructure investment strengthens our economic platform, makes America more competitive, creates millions of jobs, increases wages for American workers, and reduces the costs of goods and services for American families and consumers. Agency processes and procedures have often delayed infrastructure projects in the United States. These delays have increased project costs and blocked the American people from the full benefits of infrastructure investments. These investments are important to allowing Americans to compete and win on the world economic stage. Federal infrastructure decisions should be made with efficiency and effectiveness. These decisions should respect property rights, protect public safety, and protect the environment. The executive branch wants to streamline and speed up environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects. We have a special interest in expediting high priority projects. High priority projects include improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading critical port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways.

Sec. 2. Identification of High Priority Infrastructure Projects. For infrastructure projects that need Federal reviews and approvals, the Governor of a State, the head of any executive department or agency, or the Chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) may request a decision on whether an infrastructure project qualifies as a "high priority". The relevant agency must make this decision within 30 days based on the project's importance to general welfare, its value to the Nation, its environmental benefits, and other factors the Chairman deems relevant.

Sec. 3. Deadlines. For any project designated as a high priority, the Chairman of the CEQ must work with the head of the relevant agency to establish expedited procedures and deadlines for the project's environmental reviews and approvals. All agencies must do everything in their power to complete such reviews and approvals by the established deadlines. In the case that a deadline is not met, the head of the relevant agency must provide a written explanation to the Chairman explaining the delay. The head of the agency must also include concrete actions taken by the agency to complete such reviews and approvals as quickly as possible.

Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) All actions taken following this executive order must follow all current laws. All actions taken to follow this order must only work to the extent that federal funds are available..

(b) Nothing in this order impairs or otherwise affects:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(c) All actions taken to follow this order must follow all existing requirements and authorities to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources and methods. Nothing in this order allows actions that supersede measures established to protect the security and integrity of specific activities and associations that are in direct support of intelligence and law enforcement operations.

(d) This order does not create any right, legal benefit, or financial benefit for any party against any part of the United States government or any other person.
